This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that accurately classifies breast cancer as either benign or malignant based on various features extracted from breast cell images
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and increasing survival rates. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze breast cancer data and predict the likelihood of malignancy.
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
